# msq700
ROM dumps from Roland MSQ-700 Sequencer (1984)

The MSQ-700 has a total of 16K of ROM, split across two chips (A and B). This repo contains BIN files suitable for programming to new chips (originally 2764 type EPROMS, you can use any modern EEPROM such as the AT28C64Bs I'm using) should the originals ever fail (who knows...), as well as the two combined into a single file (if you want to disassemble it or something).
